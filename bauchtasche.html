<b> VICE: Hey, you around? </b>
    <br>
<b> Lucius:</b><span style="font-size: 20px">  <i> Always.</i> </span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b>What do you sell and where?</b>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px"><i>Mostly weed and cannabis oil, but I dabble in Xanax and ecstasy pills, usually around the east London area. Xan sells like hotcakes. London loves Xanax. Only issue is there is a lot of fake xans around.</i></span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b> Is it all word of mouth? Do strangers contact you?</b>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px"><i>Mostly word of mouth, but I get contacted online quite a bit. That is quite a good earner, actually, now, because people who contact you online are usually more willing to part with more cash. But it is higher risk, of course, cause who knows who it is gonna be?</i></span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b> How do they contact you online?</b>
    <br>
   <span style="font-size: 20px"><i> Instagram. A lot of money to be made on Instagram.</i>
    <br></span>
    <br>
<b> How has Instagram changed your business?</b>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px"><i>A lot of new faces. Most of the oil goes to people who have contacted me on Instagram. Oil can be very hard to obtain and I get plenty of it, so people will part with more cash. I have got friends who work full time through Instagram sales. I get a lot of unique strains in, strangers on the internet lap it up. It is just riskier though. Never know when it could be a police officer.</i></span>

<b> How do you judge that?</b>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px"><i>I have a vetting process, but if I give that away then they would know how to slip through it. A lot of it is just common sense. Some profiles are very suspicious and it is not worth the risk, but some people are clear cannabis enthusiasts.</i></span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b> I guess exchanging the goods is the risky part?</b>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px"><i>Yeah. I prefer areas I know where I can get a look at them before they see me. Undercovers arent hard to spot, but it could still be an informer or someone being watched. This is always a risk. I just consider it worth it.</i> </span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b> Ever had trouble with the cops?</b>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px"><i>Nah, not while selling. Ive been nicked for possession, but that was just a fine and caution. Ive had close calls. Ive had a couple of customers buy on tick and not pay back, but for the most part its been calm. Im fortunate, really.</i></span>

    <br>
<b> Have you been robbed by bogus buyers?</b>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px"><i>Never. Ive had friends whove been held at gunpoint, though. Its not a big risk, always could happen, though...</i></span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b> Whats the best thing about your job?</b>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px"><i>freedom and the drugs. I use everything I sell, so its fuckin great. Being in control of whether youre gonna leave the house or make some money today is great. I meet some jokes people, get fucked up and make money. Cant complain about that! I’ve got a problem with authority so I cant hold a normal job.</i>
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b> Why do you have a problem with authority?</b>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px"><i>I was a troublemaker at school. Its always been that way. I never liked being told what to do. I calmed down in my later teens, but Im still not big on being bossed around. A lot of people who grew up where I grew up are the same</i></span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b> What do you do in your downtime?</b>
    <br>
   <span style="font-size: 20px"> <i>In my downtime… I do drugs. Im a simple guy. I ride my bike, I fall off skateboards, I go out and get wobbly.</i></span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b> How long have you been dealing drugs and how did you get into it?</b>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px"><i>Ive been selling on and off for five years. Growing up in east London, you are surrounded by crime, so its easy to fall into. Im surprised I didnt start earlier, tbh. My best friend at the times brother sorted us out with a good link for ounces of weed, then it just picked up from there really.</i></span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b> Does your mum know you sell?</b>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px"><i>Probably has an idea.</i></span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b> What do your friends think about your job?</b>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px"><i>Some find it quite beneficial! Ive only had one girlfriend who wasnt into it. Others are relatively supportive or uninterested. My ex would let me keep bud and money in her flat, but didn’t smoke herself.</i></span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b> What do customers do that drives you insane?</b>
    <br>
   <span style="font-size: 20px"><i> Customers who want it on tick can be a nightmare. I like to have my money straight away. Dont tell me you want something then dont take it. A lot of people show interest in shit and then dont buy – it happens a lot with oil. And haggling: I dont like haggling. If I name a price, its the price. You meet some weird fuckers, people who try to be your mate, people who dont leave you alone, etc. Everyone is friendly, though, both customers and suppliers.</i></span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b> Do you have any other work? Does selling pay the bills?</b>
    <br>
   <span style="font-size: 20px"><i> I consider it freelance dealing – it isnt all day, every day, but its my main earner usually. I do a bit of work in bars, which helps because thats where half my clients are.</i></span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b> Do you plan on getting out the game?</b>
    <br>
   <span style="font-size: 20px"> <i>No, I plan on doubling down. Ive been out of the country for a few months and when I get back I wont have many other options. Ive got a fuckin degree. I need to do something with it. I might go legit, but drugs will always be a part of my life.</i></span>
    <br>
    <br>
<b> Why will drugs always be part of your life?</b>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px"><i>Ive got an addictive personality and a substance abuse problem. Its not for any particular drug. I just dont dig being sober. I enjoy drugs, Ive always been around drugs. Ive got a lot of friends in the game. Its hard to say for certain, but I dont see things changing. I do have other aspirations, but when people see you a certain way, its hard to shake that reputation.</i></span>
    <br> 
    <br>
<b> Appreciate your time, Lucius.</b>
